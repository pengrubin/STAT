\n\n\nAccording to the result of R program, there are three tests and one graph. Firstly, we can see that in F-test the p-value of F-test is p = 0.3703829 which is greater than the significance level 0.05. Therefore, there is no significant difference between the two-batch variances. Second  of all, the p-value of t-test is p = 6.868631e-35 which is less than the significance level 0.05. As a result, there is a significant difference between the two-batch means.
Finally, from the nonparametric alternative test, the p-value is 2.755647e-35<0.05, hence true location shift is not equal to 0.
From this boxplot, the mean of Batch 1  is greater than Batch 2 â€˜s. In addition, they have the same variance. Batch 2 has the lower minimum which Y=345.294 and the greater maximum which Y=821.654 than batch1.\n
